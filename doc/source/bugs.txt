Known bugs and limitations
**************************

RH 1.5D is always evolving, and there are likely to be bugs and limitations. Please send all bug reports to tiago.pereira-at-astro.uio.no and they will be dealt with as time permits. 

Current issues
==============

* If the ``scratch`` or ``output`` directories are not present, the code will crash. The error message is not very clear.
* When `pool` mode is used, the data in ``output_aux.ncdf`` (populations, etc.) is not written. This occurs because ``writeAux_p.c`` has not been rewritten to allow an efficient write of the data for a single column. 
* In ``keyword.input``, if one sets a ``SNAPSHOT`` value to be more than what is in the atmosphere file, the code will stop with an error message: ``Index exceeds dimension bound``. This error should be made more clear. 
* The atom files must not end with a blank line, otherwise ``gencol`` will fail and the program stops.
* To save the ``source_function`` and ``chi`` into the output one still needs to uncomment the relevant parts on the source code. 
* Line buffered or full buffered log options still require the user to change the source code.
* Depth refinement fails in some cases due to problems caused by cubic interpolation artefacts. 
* Using more than 4000 cores and writing full output may cause I/O slowdowns and Lustre contention in some systems.


Planned features
================

* Support for multiple snapshots in the output files.
* `pool` mode be more flexible, with the possibility of several `overlord` nodes, useful for running with more than 4000 processes.
* More flexible control of what output is written.
